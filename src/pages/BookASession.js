        Saving Your Time and Enhancing Your Learning

        Did you know that <b>more than 80% of students</b> encounter difficulties when
        learning new coding concepts or encountering errors? It's a common
        challenge, and many students attempt to solve these problems
        independently, which is a commendable habit. However, only a few are
        able to effectively resolve their issues on their own. And even those
        who do often find themselves spending countless hours or even days
        grappling with a seemingly simple error that could be resolved in just
        five minutes.
